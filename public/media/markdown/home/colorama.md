**Genre:** Survival Party Game | **Status:** In Development 🛠️

*Colorama* is a high-stakes, hypercasual survival experience. Players are dropped onto a vibrant grid of tiles and must navigate shifting patterns to find safety before the floor vanishes. 

* **The Loop:** Navigate tiles, deploy dynamic items, and outlast the competition.
* **The Vibe:** A "Vibrant Industrial" stylized aesthetic.
* **The Edge:** Fast-paced rounds with a shrinking safety window that turns simple movement into a frantic battle of wits and reflexes.

> *"With Colorama, we’re creating a game that is as much about rhythm and momentum as it is about survival."* — **Justin, Founder & CTO** 🎙️
