## **🚀 Our Vision**
Sparkade is an independent game development studio dedicated to redefining the relationship between player and motion. We believe that the next generation of digital experiences should be as physically engaging as they are mentally stimulating. 

By prioritizing **Kinetic** feedback, **Sustainable** processes, and **Approachable** mechanics, we create worlds that invite everyone to play—and empower them to stay.
